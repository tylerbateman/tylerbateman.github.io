<p><h3>Welcome to a website endorsing me and how awesome I am.</h3></p>
<p>
<p>A brief introduction of myself: I'm a sophomore at UMaine working to get a degree in Finance.<br>
I enjoy the outdoors, as well as my fair share of inside activities. I hope to start my own business<br>
while still in college to have a good idea as to what I'd like to do when I graduate, because as of now<br>
I'm pretty clueless. I live in southern Maine, within walking distance to one of the largest lakes in<br>
Maine. I'm very fortunate for what I have in life, and I'd like to tell you more about it.</p>

<p>I am making this website for my course: BUA 235 Information Systems. It's a very interesting class<br>
that captures my attention easily, and I hope that I can use the lessons I've learned so far to further<br>
my technological skills regarding website coding and maintenance. I hope to start a company, and it will<br>
be in my best interest to have my own functional, easily accessible, and simple website to connect myself<br>
to potential customers from around the globe.</p>
