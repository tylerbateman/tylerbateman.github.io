		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<h3>Some Information</h3>
		<p>My name is Tyler Bateman, I am 19 years old and currently reside in Naples, ME.<br> [pic of sebago]
		I am the youngest out of three siblings. I enjoy snowboarding, wakeboarding, snowmobiling,<br>
		hiking, collecting shoes, and building cars. You can learn more about those hobbies <a href="Hobbies.html"> here<a/>.<br>
		
		
		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>I started my education in 2001 by attending preschool in New Hampshire. After this, I continued my actual<br>
		education in Poland, Maine (Yes, it is where they make Poland Springs water, and yes, we did have Poland Spring<br>
		water coming out of our tap for free) from grades K-12. Now I continue as a second year student here at UMaine.</p>
		
		<p>I chose to attend UMaine because of it's engineering reputation. I had always wanted to become a mechanical engineer for as long as<br>
		I can remember, so I applied to school that offered engineering or were centered around that program. I applied to Roger Williams <br>
		University in Rhode Island, Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston, Clarkson University in New York, and finally UMaine. Even<br>
		though I was accepted into all of the schools I applied for, I believed that UMaine had, by far, the best mechanical engineering<br>
		program and facilities of the four schools, so that leads to where I am now.</p>
		
		<p>After my first year of college, I figured out that I didn't want to become a mechanical engineer, and that the program wasn't what<br>
		I was looking for. Being strong in math led me to changing my major to Finance in the Business College. This was a huge deal for me<br>
		because I had always told myself I wanted to become an engineer, and I ended up deciding to completely switch away from it, knowing<br>
		that it would be almost impossible to get back into the engineering college if I changed my mind. So far, I've loved every day of it.</p>
