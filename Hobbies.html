	<h3>Snowboarding and Wakeboarding</h3>
		<p>One of my favorite things to do that I have loved since I was a child, is snowboarding. My oldest brother taught me how to snowboard at the age of three,<br>
		so I've been snowboarding for a total of 16 consecutive years now. A dream of mine is to snowboard all over the globe, from the Rockies of America, to<br>
		Japan's top resorts. Once winter ended, I was always so bored because I never had anything to do. I didn't like to skateboard like a lot of other snowboarders<br>
		do, so I turned to wakeboarding. It was just like snowboarding, and it hurts even less if you fall. I've only been wakeboarding for a short amount of time, but<br>
		I look forward to wakeboarding almost every day this coming summer at my new home that is next to a lake.</p>
		
	<h3>Sneaker Collecting</h3>
		<p>A large part of my motivation to start my <a href="future business.html">business</a> is that I'm really into shoes. Once I have a steady income, I will actually<br>
		start buying and collecting them, but right now I like to research rarity, as well as how to tell a fake shoe from a real shoe. As ridiculous as it sounds, many foreign<br>
		companies produce replica famous and expensive shoes. One of the most popular shoes they replicate is called the Adidas Yeezy by Kanye West. To give an idea as to how <br>
		limited it is, a pair was released worldwide on February 25th, and it sold out within 30 minutes. There were only 5400 pairs available throughout all of North America,<br>
		and it retailed at $220. Now people who were lucky enough to get a pair have been reselling them for over $2000. It's an absolutely insane market, and I can't wait to <br>
		dip my foot in it.</p>
		
	<h3>Working on Cars</h3>
		<p>Another hobby of mine is working on my car. I became really interested in cars and how they work when I was around 14. That was when I entered the market looking for<br>
		my own car to buy once I turned 16. My first car was a 2007 Subaru WRX. It's a type of car that comes with a turbo in it, and has a lot of options to help performance under<br>
		the hood, as well as on the exterior. Long story short, I painfully ended up selling it, and bought a 2012 Scion tC, which I still have today. This has been a much easier car<br>
		to work on, and has helped expand my general knowledge around cars. I've installed an aftermarket short ram intake which slightly improves performance as well as gas mileage.<br>
		My plans for this car is to install miscellaneous led lights which include fog lights as well as aftermarket speakers and a subwoofer, this will teach me more about the <br>
		electrical side of cars. Then I will put aftermarket rims on which along with making the car look goos, it reduces weight. Then I will install an aftermarket exhaust which<br>
		goes hand in hand with the intake and will help performance. A huge life goal of mine is to own my own car lift in my personal garage to make it easier to work on me and my<br>
		family's vehicles.</p>
