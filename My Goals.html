		<h1>My Goals and Ambitions</h1>

		<h2>My Goals for 2017</h2>
		<p>Within the next year I hope to start my own business. Reselling is a pretty popular business as of late. If people get a chance to<br>
		purchase a limited shoe(a popular one being the Adidas Yeezy) they can choose to sell it to a population known as sneakerheads.<br>
		Sneakerheads are people who just really enjoy collecting shoes, and are very active in the sneaker community. There are many in the world, and<br>
		most of them enjoy having more than one pair of specific types of shoes. Reselling just one pair of limited sneakers can produce<br>
		thousands of dollars in profit.</p>
		
		<p>I want to start an online retail store that people can list their products to sell to other interested people. Products<br>
		include: Limited shoes, limited apparel, as well as my own companies apparel. I strive to be a resource for people that helps them connect<br>
		with other people, and sell their products through a trusted company, as well as help people get the most money for their products.<br>
		Different websites in the business take up to 20% of the sale, including Ebay, and I think that is really unfair for the customers.<br>
		Along with this, sneaker customizations are pretty popular. I would to think of myself as a pretty creative and artsy<br>
		person, so I think that I can incorporate that into my business. This way, I am not targeting just the percentage of <br>
		people who will buy expensive sneakers that the majority view as "overpriced".</p>
		
		<p>Like most fads, such as sneaker and limited clothes collecting, it will eventually end. So this company is temporary, and a short term goal for me.<br>
		It is also a way for me to gain experience in the retail and reselling world, as well as experience running my own small company. I'll use this experience<br>
		to decide whether or not I will continue to pursue a career in retail, or as a business owner.</p>
