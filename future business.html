		<h1><i>My Business Dream</i></h1>
										<img src="Businesslogo.jpg">

<p>The business that I would like to start will be named Ty's Supply. The gist of it, is that I want to become the middle man. I take in someone's<br>
shoes or apparel that they wish to sell, I list them for sale, find a buyer who will pay the most for the product and then sell it to them. I get<br>
15% of the sale (12.5% with a promotional code), and the rest of the money goes to the person who gave me the product to sell. I am competitive <br>
because other companies like this one, take a substantially larger percentage of the sale. My goal is to get the person selling the shoe, as much<br>
money as they can for their shoe or piece of clothing.
</p>

<p>I know that it will take a lot of time for my business to start up. In the shoe game you need a lot of good reputation to be well known. Since <br>
this is the case, I want to offer other services such as sneaker customizations. If someone wants their shoe customized, they send me their shoe,<br>
they choose a design that they want and they pay for that. The more complicated the design, the more money they will be spending. An alternative <br>
that I will offer is shoes that have already been pre-made. But, this will cost substantially more for the customer than just sending in a pair of<br>
shoes that they already own.</p>

<p>My whole goal for creating this website, is that I will be able to turn it into my business website. There are things that I will need to resolve,<br>
such as security, and a way for customers to pay with credit/debit/PayPal. It will take quite a lot of time, and I may even just pay for a website<br>
that is already secure, but I want to do it for the experience, and because it personally interests me.</p>
